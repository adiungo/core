## About This Project

The purpose of Adiungo is to help people take control of their online identity, and archive all of their online content
on their website automatically. It is intended to be a curator of sorts - something that will automatically ensure that
whenever you do something online, that information is collected, and stored in a single place for _you_ to access in
whatever way you want.
